ðŸš€ Secure and Scalable EKS Infrastructure using Terraform on AWS

Designed and deployed a highly available, secure Amazon EKS cluster across multiple availability zones (us-east-1a, us-east-1b) using Terraform. The architecture includes:

Private/Public Subnet Isolation for secure and controlled network access

NAT Gateways for outbound internet connectivity for private subnets

Spot Instance Worker Nodes to optimize cost-efficiency

EKS Managed Node Groups integrated with CNI and CSI plugins

Automated Terraform Workflows integrated with GitHub for Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

Emphasis on Security Best Practices, High Availability, and Cost Optimization

This setup provides a production-grade Kubernetes environment with robust security and DevOps automation.

THIS IS THE COMPLETE CI/CD
